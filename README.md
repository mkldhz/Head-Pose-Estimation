# Head-Pose-Estimation

Head pose estimation is a machine learning project that aims to predict the orientation of a person's head in 3D space. The project involves drawing the three rotational axes of the head (pitch, yaw, and roll) by predicting the corresponding angles for each axis using machine learning models.

# Dataset
The [AFLW2000 dataset](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/xiangyuzhu/projects/3DDFA/Database/AFLW2000-3D.zip) is used for this project which consists of 2000 images and 2000 matlab files which contain the three rotational axes of the head (pitch, yaw, and roll) for each image.
